# Real-time-clock-Application


The Real-Time Clock application is a web-based project developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides a dynamic and interactive clock that displays the current time accurately. The HTML structure defines the layout and components of the clock, while CSS styles are applied to enhance the visual appearance. JavaScript is responsible for fetching the current time from the system and updating it in real-time on the web page. The clock includes features such as displaying the hours, minutes, and seconds, as well as an optional date display. It serves as a useful tool for users who require an accurate and easily accessible time display on their web browser.
